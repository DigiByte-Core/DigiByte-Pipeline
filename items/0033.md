### Submitted by

### Bounty details
There is currently no bounty available for this

### Is this being worked on?
Not currently

### Specifics
BTCPay Server is a self-hosted, open-source cryptocurrency payment processor. It's secure, private, censorship-resistant and free. https://btcpayserver.org/

In addition to Bitcoin it supports a number of altcoins but DigiByte is not currently one of them.

Documentation on BTCPay can be found here: https://docs.btcpayserver.org/

Altcoin integration guidelines are here: https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Altcoins/

By integrating with BTCPay we would enable users to setup their own DigiByte payment processor that interfaces directly with their own node, with no third party required.

It is worth noting that users can install BTCPay in one click from their Umbrel Bitcoin node making it trivial for anyone to get started with: https://getumbrel.com/
