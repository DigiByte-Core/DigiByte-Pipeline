Potentially

### Is this being worked on?
Yes

### Specifics
The v1 Community Information Paper was written in 2019. The fact that the original writters of the infopaper included v1 on the cover page meant they understood there would be revisions to the document. The infopaper should be reviewed and revised especially with upgrades to DigiByte Core, protocol upgrades and newer implementations. The infopaper should be kept in a repository within the DigiByte-Core organization with other docoments and guides. Updating the document will require pull request and review process.  

### Work progress
Currently in planning phase
