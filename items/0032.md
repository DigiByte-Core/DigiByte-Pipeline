### Bounty details
There is currently no bounty available for this

### Is this being worked on?

### Specifics
ON the 18th of June, Coinbase announced Rosetta:

Specifications:

This is something we could / should support, and it would certainly make things easier in the long run with the likes of Yoshi wanting to redo a new block explorer amongst other things
