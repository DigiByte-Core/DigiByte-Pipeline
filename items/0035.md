### Bounty details
Potentially

### Is this being worked on?
Yes

### Specifics
There needs to be a repository which houses the Documents and Guides refferenced on the DigiByte website https://www.digibyte.org/en-us/#docs. By creating a repository and housing the Integration guide, media sheet and v1. community info paper, updates can be made through the pull request and review process once in repository. The documents and guides need to be reviewed and revised periodically especially when there are updates to DigiByte Core, to protocols and new implementations.  

### Work progress
Currently in the planning phase
