# Implement RandomX

### Submitted by
@ChillingSilence

### Bounty details
Being raised: https://medium.com/@josiah_digibyte/randomx-for-cpu-mining-on-digibyte-75c6a0d6e29c

### Is this being worked on?
Yes

### Specifics
CPU-focused mining through RandomX has been proposed and largely accepted by the greater part of the community, ideally in tandem with ProgPoW.

This would be implemented in to 8.19.x ideally activating shortly thereafter, in order to minimize the amount of times end-users / entities have to upgrade (Say, a 11,520 block distance between the two being 2 days).
