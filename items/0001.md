# Implementation of Schnorr Signatures

### Submitted by
@ChillingSilence

### Bounty details
There is potentially a bounty available for this, please seek clarification from @ChillingSilence prior to commencement

### Is this being worked on?
Yes

### Specifics
Schnorr Signatures have a number of benefits over ECDSA which has been discussed elsewhere. This item is for the implementation of Schnorr Signatures in to DigiByte Core

At present there are no plans to include any form of CoinJoin / Shuffle in the Core Wallet, focus should be on a basic implementation allowing users to optionally utilize them similar to SegWit.

These are not expected to be default at present, that change will likely occur further in the future.

There is already implementation specifics for BTC available on GitHub which can be used as a basis, along with BCH having implemented Schnorr in May '19. Between these two it should assist with implementation greatly.

Work will be:
1. Allow Schnorr signatures (along-side existing sigs)
2. Implement MultiSig support
3. Do a test-upgrade on testnet
4. Propose a date for the upgrade (X block height)
