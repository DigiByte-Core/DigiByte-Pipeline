### Specifics
DigiAsset Core is being developed by Matthew Cornelisse: https://github.com/mctrivia
DigiAsset Core will be a fast open-source C++ program that uses DigiByte Core and decodes the DigiAsset data stored in the chain to allow easy working with DigiAssets. Beyond DigiAssets it also handles: DigiByte Domains, Voting, Exchange Rates, Know Your Customer and UTXO Data. All of this data will be made accessible through an API interface, to be used with wallets, chain explorers, and other services. DigiAsset-Core is being funded through donations, for more info visit: https://digiassetcore.digiassetx.com/.
The project is opensource in the DigiAsset-Core Github organization / DigiAsset_Core repository: https://github.com/DigiAsset-Core/DigiAsset_Core.
